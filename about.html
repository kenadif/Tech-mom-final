    <div class="about">
        My name is Kenadi Fullmer. I grew up in a small town in Idaho, called Menan. I come from a big tight nit family. I have 3 brothers, 3 sisters, 3 nephews, and 9 nieces. After I graduated high school in 2018 from Rigby High, I moved to Preston, Idaho. After living there for about a year I moved to Logan. I met my husband in December of 2019, we got married November of 2021. Currently I am a shift supervisor at Casper's Ice Cream and have been with them for just shy of 5 years. In my free time I enjoy spending time outside, going on hikes paddle boarding, spending time with my family in Idaho, and binge watching my favorite shows on Hulu with my husband.
